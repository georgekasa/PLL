# PLL
This repository has a goal to make :
1)time domain in Octave
2)design a passive RC filter 3rd order based on Banerjee
3)time domain in Cadence

I believe that the rapid advancements in AI and technology are largely driven by the open-source movement. 
By sharing this code openly, I aim to contribute to that momentum, fostering collaboration and innovation in PLL design.
